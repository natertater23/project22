// TO DO: implement this function properly
// Play the chutes and ladders until a player reaches the winning square 100
//    - Each player takes turn to roll the die and moves to the new square by invoking rollDieAndMove.
//         If the new square is outside of the board, the player stays put
//    - Player's new position is checked against the game board's checkChutesLadders
//    - checkChutesLadders returns a different square if player lands on a chute or a ladder
//    - Player's position is then set to the new position as indicated by checkChutesLadders
//          If player lands on a chute or a ladder, player slides down or climbs up
//    - If player lands on the winning square 100, game is over
//    - playGame returns after congratulating and printing the winner's name
